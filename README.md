# PHP-Modular üöÄ

**PHP-Modular** is a modular PHP framework with an MVC architecture, designed for building scalable and maintainable web applications. Created as a personal learning project, this framework provides a solid foundation, inspired by Laravel's conventions, for developing applications from scratch.

### Features ‚ú®

* **Modular Architecture:** Each feature is encapsulated within its own module, including dedicated controllers, models, services, repositories, and routes.
* **MVC Pattern:** Follows the Model-View-Controller pattern for a clear separation of concerns.
* **Dependency Management:** Uses **Composer** to manage and load project dependencies.
* **Database Flexibility:** With support for **Eloquent ORM**, you can easily connect to **MySQL**, **MariaDB**, and **PostgreSQL** databases.
* **API Authentication:** Includes support for **JSON Web Token (JWT)**-based authentication.
* **Automation:** Provides a `bin` script to automatically generate the structure for new modules.
